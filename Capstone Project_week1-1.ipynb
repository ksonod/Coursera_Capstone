    "Zurich is one of the largest cities in Switzerland. Lately, Japanese food can be easily found in the supermarkets of Zurich. This fact implies that people are getting more interested in Japanese cuisine. Considering this fact, opening a new Japanese restaurant in Zurich would be a good idea. However, there are already some Japanese restaurants in Zurich. Hence, it is important, especially for people who are interested in opening a new Japanese restaurant in Zurich, to know which area is less competitive. In this capstone project, I will show which district of Zurich is the best for opening a new Japanese restaurant."
